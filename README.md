# map_of_volcanoes
This interactive web map displays active volacanoes in the U.S.

The map has 3 layers: 
- base map layer
- border layer that defines countries and gives them a specific color based on population size
- point layer with volcano names and pop-up windows that show their height

This project was built with Python and FolioLib.
